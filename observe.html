  <h3>Observe real life</h3>

  <p>Once in a while what you have in mind, as you enter a room full
    of people, is exactly what they need. Most often, though, it's not.</p>
  <p>Agility means
    the ability to quickly adapt the development process to an evolving environment.
    But there is an evolution which is an order of magnitude faster than the change in the
    business requirements: it's your comprehension of the business, of the interactions
    between its entities, of the informal human knowledge that, eventually, will (need to)
    be formalised and, somehow, become code.</p>
  <p>The amount of pain and disappointment in the process depends on your ability to
    observe. Becoming aware: what is external of you, the scope of the project;
    and what happens in your brain, while you observe.</p>
  <p>What exists right now, before projecting any ideas on it, is a humble seed of
    knowledge that, when discovered in time, will protect and guide all new
    inventions.</p>
