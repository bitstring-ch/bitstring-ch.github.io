  <h1>Luigi Sgro</h1>
  <p>A Software Developer and Architect with a University Degree in Engineering, I started programming computers as
    a hobby when I was a teenager, and continued to do it professionally after the University.</p>
  <p>I developed an early passion for C language, system programming and the UNIX operating system. 
    I have been an enthusiastic Linux user and advocate since 1996.</p>
  <p>In 2007 I decided to concentrate on Java, and soon after, I started working in the
    finance sector.</p>
  <p>In 2010 I moved to London and continued my education with CQF (Certificate in Quantitative Finance), 
    getting certified in July 2011, while working as software developer at Citigroup. </p>
  <p>Thanks to the rapid technological evolution undergoing in the financial industry,
    starting with my first assignment in London, I had the option
    to work on several technologies, on a variety of challenging applications:
    parallel computation, memory caches, micro-services, severless architecture.</p>
  <p>Since 2013 I live in Zurich, Switzerland, where I continue to work in the finance sector, 
    focusing on trading and risk management systems for financial institutions and hedge funds.</p>
  <p>For the last six years Iâ€™ve been using prevalently the Scala language, acquiring a strong
    competence in functional programming,
    while maintaining a keen interest in the evolution of Java and its ecosystem.</p>
  <p>Over the last three years, while working on derivative pricing and risk systems, I acquired
    hands-on knowledge on a number of languages and frameworks popular in analytics:
    Python, R, Matlab, Spark.</p>
  <p>In 2019 I have founded Bitstring, a company based in Zurich, with the purpose of
    offering consulting services to corporate clients.</p>
