  <h1>Luigi Sgro</h1>
  <p>A software developer and architect, I have had the opportunity to start
    programming computers professionally right after the university.</p>
  <p>My early passions were C language, system programming and the UNIX operating system.
    I have been an enthusiastic Linux user and advocate from 1996.</p>
  <p>In 2007 I decided to concentrate on Java, and soon after, I started to work in the
    finance sector.</p>
  <p>In 2010 I moved to London, to attend the course for the Certificate in Quantitative Finance,
    while working as developer for Citigroup. I passed all the exams and got certified in July 2011.</p>
  <p>Thanks to the rapid technological evolution undergoing in the financial industry,
    starting with my first assignment in London, I had the option
    to work on several technologies, on a variety of challenging applications:
    parallel computation, memory caches, micro-services, severless architecture.</p>
  <p>Since 2013 I transitioned from Java to the Scala language, maintaining a keen interest
    in the evolution of Java and its ecosystem.</p>
  <p>Over the last three years, while working on pricing and risk systems, I acquired
    hands-on knowledge on a number of languages and frameworks popular in analytics:
    Python, R, Matlab, Spark.</p>
  <p>From 2019 I work as free-lance in the Zurich/Zug region, looking for ways to leverage
    my knowledge and experience to provide high quality software and leading edge consulting
    to corporate clients.</p>
