  <h3>Development</h3>
  <p>Sometimes, pressing business needs push development teams to the edge: despite agile
    methodologies, modern architectures and top skills, priorities can't always align
    to stakeholder desires.
    Or maybe capacity is not the issue, but incorporating a non-core technology,
    which is required only for a specific module or functionality, is not the most
    efficient way to leverage the in-house team.
    We can complement our client's team with research and development of specific aspects
    or portions of a development project.
    Our extensive experience and the constant effort to keep up with the latest frameworks
    and methodologies will assure a timely and effective delivery of business relevant
    functionalities.
    Special attention to writing clean code, comprehensive test and documentation
    means seamlessy incorporating and maintaining the new material in the existing code
    life-cycle.</p>
  <h3>Consulting</h3>
  <p>Knowledge is power.
    There are cases when new or little known technologies can make the difference.
    Even the best team, equipped with the latest technology stack, when
    confronted with a new project, can benefit from a fresh look from the outside.
    Especially when it's from hard-core technologists with hands-on experience on many
    successful projects.
    The technological acceleration of the latest years in software development, with the
    re-appearance of functional programming, the new offer of <emph>serverless</emph>
    solutions coupled with the growth of the capabilities within the browser, cause fast
    obsolescence of technological stacks, unexpected opportunities, and a constant need to
    question the existing software architecture paradigms.
    Only a pragmatic approach, together with the ability to find good practices beyond the
    hype, will help putting a development project on stable architectural ground,
    and being able to reap the benefits of new technologies when sensible, while hedging the
    inevitable risks.
    We can offer a leading edge perspective acquired in top-tier technical environments, a
    very diverse experience in multiple business areas, and a critical evaluation of the
    latest technological trends.
